Morse Code on STM324F411FE - Discovery Board Using UART & CDC (USB Communication Devices Class)


About
This is a project based on developing 4 letters of morse code named " UART " using the push button (PA0) and transmitting (TX mode) to another STM32F411FE disco - board using (RX Mode). Imagine one board playing as morse code messenger and another board played as receiver.
Moreover, In additional this project is also situable displaying the morse result on the same board using the USB communication device class on STM32F411FE Disco - Board.
